        School has taught me a lot about Computer Science and the various related fields, but I'm excited to apply this knowledge in real-world projects!</p>

        I'm a very logical thinker, so I always base my reasoning on facts. In the data and analytics field, I am surrounded by so much information, 
        which can help me and potential clients/businesses make informed decisions!</p>
        <p class='fade-in'>Outside of school, Iâ€™m passionate about staying active. I enjoy volleyball, weightlifting, and badminton. When I'm not at the gym or on the court, you can find me gaming or hanging out with friends.</p>

                    <h3>Toronto House Listing Analysis</h3>
                    <p>This was a project I made in the summer of 2023. Because I am interested in data analytics, I decided to make this project to get some
                    hands-on experience with <strong>web scraping (data collection), data organization, and data visualization.</strong><br><br>

                    For this project, I gathered information (webscrapped) on house listings located in Toronto, Ontario using Python and multiple frameworks. These included 
                    Beautiful Soup (for web scraping), Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy (to organize, clean, and present data in a visually appealing way).<br><br>
                    I had two hypotheses for this project: I wanted to know if the location of the listing would increase in value relative to its proximity to downtown Toronto,
                    and if the number of bedrooms and bathrooms would increase the price of the listing.<br><br>

                    After gathering all the information I needed to test these hypotheses, 
                    the data confirmed that the closer the house was to downtown Toronto, the higher the price. Additionally, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms also had a positive correlation with the price of the listing.<br><br>
                    This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of data analytics and the real estate market in Toronto. <br><br>
                    
                    You can find the full project and code on my Github <a href='https://github.com/CarandangC/Toronto-Market-Webscraper' target='_blank'>here</a>.<br>
                    There is also a readme file that also explains my findings.</p>

                    <h3>SoundCheck</h3>
                    <p>This was a school project where I worked with four other people and we were tasked to create a simulated, online ticketing system (similar to Ticketmaster).<br><br>
                    We used <strong>HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL</strong> for this project. I was also the lead <strong>backend developer</strong> for this project. This meant that I was in charge of creating
                    the databases for users, events, shopping carts associated with each user's account, checkout verification, and event information which includes quantity of tickets.<br><br>

                    This project was a fun one to do because I was able to work collaboratively, learn how to create a product using the <strong>software development life cycle (SDLC)</strong>,
                    and honestly opened my eyes on what I could create if I put my mind to it. <br><br>

                    <h3>Calorie Calculator</h3>
                    <p>This was a personal project I made back in the summer of 2023. I am very into fitness if you have seen in my about page and nutrition goes hand in hand.
                    So I wanted to create a program that would give me the amount of calories based on a food item and its weight. This project was something practical and also cool to make as it was one of the first personal projects of mine.<br><br>
        
                    For this project, I used <strong>HTML, CSS, and Python,</strong> to create a user-friendly interface. I also used the <strong>Flask</strong> framework for the backend.<br><br>

                    What I enjoyed about this project was using an API for the first time. I used an API that had a catalog of over <strong>900 thousand</strong> food items that had many things related to the item, for example the nutritional value, macros, and of course, calories (per serving).
                    I was able to make an interesting and practical project that aligned with my values and introduced me to the world of APIs. <br><br>

                    <p>This is a project I started in Winter of 2024 and still updating regularly whenever I need to add new experiences or projects.<br><br>

                    I built this project because I always wanted to have a place where I could showcase my projects, and also to have another project that provides some sort of real life application and use.<br><br>

                    This project uses <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Bootstrap framework.</strong><br><br>
                    What I enjoy(ed) about creating this project is that I have full control on how I design my website. Personally, I don't think I'm a very creative person, but making this website showed me how creative I could be, 
                    weather that is the theme, the layout, or just ideas on what things I could do to make it better (I was thinking a dark mode, don't ya think?).<br><br>

                    <p>This was a project idea I wanted to start for a while because I love listening to music and I wanted to get some experience with PowerBI. So I patiently waited till the end of the year to get rquest my data from Spotify.<br><br>
                    
                    If you are not familliar with Spotify Wrapped, it is a yearly event that Spotify hosts where it tells you your listening history throughout the year. Mainly your most played artists and songs. I wanted to make something
                    that replicated that using my own Spotify data. I also included a <strong>heatmap</strong> that shows what parts of the week I would listen to music the most. I also included a slider so you can choose the time frame of my listening history.<br><br>

                    This project uses <strong>Microsoft PowerBI</strong> and some <strong>DAX</strong> functions.<br><br>

                    What I learned about this project was just tinkering around with PowerBI and also learning about my own Spotify listening from certain time periods. It made me remember that during the summer I was addicted to this very specifc song called touch
                    and I would play it all day everday! Thats probably the reason as to why it was my number one in the year of 2024 hahaha!<br><br>
