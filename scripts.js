        <p class='fade-in'>Hey! My name is Carlos, and I'm currently studying at Toronto Metropolitan University. 
        School has taught me a lot about Computer Science and the various related fields, but I'm excited to apply this knowledge in real-world projects!</p>
        <p class='fade-in'>I am a Python enthusiast and I am also interested in the data and analytics field. However, since I'm still a student I am open to other fields as well, particularly software engineering.
        I'm a very logical thinker so I always base my reasonings on facts. And in the data and analytics field, I am surrounded with so much information
        which can help me and potential clients/business make informed decisions!
        <p class='fade-in'>Outside of school, Iâ€™m passionate about staying active. I enjoy volleyball, weightlifting, and badminton. When I'm not at the gym or on the court, you can find me gaming or hanging out with friends.</p>
