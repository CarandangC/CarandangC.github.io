        School has taught me a lot about Computer Science and the various related fields, but I'm excited to apply this knowledge in real-world projects!</p>
        <p class='fade-in'>I am a Python enthusiast and I am also interested in the data and analytics field. However, since I'm still a student I am open to other fields as well, particularly software engineering.
        I'm a very logical thinker so I always base my reasonings on facts. And in the data and analytics field, I am surrounded with so much information
        which can help me and potential clients/business make informed decisions!
        <p class='fade-in'>Outside of school, Iâ€™m passionate about staying active. I enjoy volleyball, weightlifting, and badminton. When I'm not at the gym or on the court, you can find me gaming or hanging out with friends.</p>

    <h3>Toronto House listing analysis</h3>
    <p>This was a project I made in the summer of 2023. Because I am interested in data analyatics, I decided to make this project to get some
    hands on experience on webscraping (data collection), data organziation, and data visualization.<br><br>
    For this project I webscrapped house listings in Toronto, Ontario using Python and multiple frameworks. This includes
    Beautiful Soup (for webscraping), Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy (to organize, clean, and present data in a visually appealing way).<br><br>
    I had two hypotheses for this project. I wanted to know if the location of the listing would increase relative to how close it was to downtown Toronto
    and if the number of bedrooms and bathrooms would increase the price of the listing. <br><br>
    After gathering all the information I needed to see if this was true,
    the data indeed proved that the closer the house was to downtown Toronto, the higher the price. Additionally, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms also had a positive correlation with the price of the listing.<br><br>
    This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of data analytics and the real estate market in Toronto. You can find the full project and code on my <a href='https://github.com/CarandangC/Toronto-Market-Webscraper' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p>
